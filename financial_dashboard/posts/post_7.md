### 1. The 24-Hour Rule
Wait 24 hours before buying anything over $50. You'll be surprised how often the urge passes.

### 2. Audit Your Subscriptions
Check your credit card statement. Do you really need 4 streaming services?

### 3. Cook Once, Eat Twice
Meal prepping isn't just for fitness gurus. Cooking larger portions saves time and money.

### 4. Use Cash for "Fun Money"
It's harder to overspend when you can physically see the money disappearing.

### 5. Automate Savings
Pay yourself first. Set up auto-transfers to your savings account on payday.
