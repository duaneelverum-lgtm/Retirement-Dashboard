   - On the first run, it will automatically set up the Python environment (installing dependencies).
   - This may take a minute or two.
2. The dashboard will open in your default web browser (http://localhost:8505).

Data:
- The data is stored in `financial_dashboard/data/finance.json`.
- This version comes with SAMPLE DATA.
- All your personal data from Version 1 has been excluded.
